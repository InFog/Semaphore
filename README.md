# Semaphore

Semaphore is a simple Python/Tkinter app to help monitoring status from a given
command.

I mainly use it for unit tests.

## Usage

Using semaphore is pretty simple, here are some examples:

 semaphore -c "py.test" -t 5

The line above will call semaphore to run py.test every 5 seconds.
